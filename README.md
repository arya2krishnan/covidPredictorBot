# covidPredictorBot
A Coronavirus Predictor Bot for Discord

## Inspiration
We were inspired to make to this bot after we started talking about when the coronavirus would end and when we would be able to go back to our original lives. Wanting to have a sense of when this virus would end, we created this bot to hopefully solve that problem. 

## Project Overview
Using previous coronavirus data, it predicts the number of cases that we will have tomorrow, and displays data based on that. We wanted to make it a discord bot because we frequently use discord, so it would be easy to pull up the numbers if we were on the app.

## How We Built It
We coded this discord bot using Python, using the SKLearn and Numpy libraries and made a multiple linear regression model to get our data.

## Challenges We Ran Into 
Some challenges that we ran into was figuring how the SKL library worked and how the SKL Library did regression. Understanding the Discord bot API was also a challenge that we had.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of making a discord bot, because we have not done something like that this. We are also very proud of learning how the basics of machine learning worked, because we are very new to programming so this was all very new to us.

## What we Learned
We learned how to do regression modeling, and some of the basics of machine learning. We also learned how the SKLearn and Numpy libraries worked and how the Discord bot API works. 

## What's Next
I want to be able to predict the number of cases in different countries and specific states, as our bot only predicts the number of cases for the whole US right now. We also want to use more complicated prediction models in the future because we just started learning about these models and realize that a multiple linear regression test is pretty basic.
